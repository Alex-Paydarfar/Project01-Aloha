My First Red Academy Project. I used HTML/CSS for the layout and styling and I used jQuery for the carousel and smooth scrolling.

I learned many things while doing but this project but just to name a few: 
    Implementing smooth scrolling and flickity carousel using jQuery.
    Don't be afraid to start over especially if you weren't doing mobile first!
    Border box is very important to keep your spacing in check!
    the order you put your links and scripts in your mark-up is very important to them functioning well!
